# Global-Electronics-Retailer

**Introduction:**  
Maven Electronics is a global retailer offering a wide range of products, including computers, cell phones, TVs, cameras, and appliances, through both online and in-store channels. Despite its diverse product portfolio, the company has faced challenges in maintaining revenue growth.

**Problem:**    
Revenue has been on a downward trend since 2020. Management lacks a clear understanding of the factors driving this decline and needs a consolidated view of the data to identify performance trends and make informed decisions.

**Objective:**  
Consolidate data into a unified model and create an interactive report to help management explore performance trends, identify revenue decline factors, and drive data-driven decisions.

**Conclusion:**  
The analysis shows that computer products and home appliances generate the most revenue, with the U.S. and in-store sales contributing the majority. Despite steady growth in orders from 2016 to 2019, revenue declined sharply after 2020, impacted by the pandemic. Delivery times improved significantly, dropping to 3.8 days in 2021, and customers aged 30+ drove most sales. To address the revenue decline, Maven Electronics should focus on boosting online sales, targeted marketing, and customer engagement strategies.
